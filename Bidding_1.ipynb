      "This document describes a system for placing applications on Amazon EC2 Spot-instances while ensuring availability in the presence of Spot-instance losses. Spot-instances are ephemeral, and their availability is subject to their _current price_ and the _bid-price_. Spot instance prices are set by Amazon --- loosely based on a market-auction and are recomputed atleast once an hour.  To acquire a spot instance, users place a bid by choosing a bidding price. If this bid is higher than the current-price, the instance is granted and runs for as long as the price stays below the bid-price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since spot-instances can be terminated at any time, they are not suitable for hosting applications which cannot handle node-failures. Our work describes an approach wherein we use Yank to ameliorate this problem and migrate the application-VM from the spot-instance to a non-ephemeral on-demand instance."
